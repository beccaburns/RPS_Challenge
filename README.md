## First Things, First
### Testing Your Code

For this challenge, I decided to utilize NPM E2E Training Wheels to complete unit & feature tests on my code. With E2E Training Wheels, you will notice that your feature tests and unit tests are divided among two different folders. 
- Unit Tests go in the Spec folder
- Feature Tests go in the Features folder - makes sense, right?

There are a whole lot of things that E2E provides, but we'll get into that later.

For now, let's get to coding! To make it easy, all of the code that we write in this challenge, will reside in the SRC folder.
